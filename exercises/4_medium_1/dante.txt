Above Man’s war-wracked world a veteran throng
Of singing spirits gather in the air,
Called from the Poets’ Heaven to take their share
In Right’s impending victory over Wrong.

Far in their van the Eagle Eye of Song
Looms o’er Ravenna, where he died, and where
He saw God’s Freedom in the dazzling glare
Of visions, which to every race belong.

Him his redeemed, united Italy —
Her Alps new crowned with Monza’s iron band,
Her Hadria wedded with her Doge’s ring —
Hails as the Prophet-Bard of Liberty;
And bids the free of every tongue and land
Join in her Ave, and their tribute bring.
